ob_start();
print 'foo';    // This never prints because ob_end_clean just empties
ob_end_clean(); //    the buffer and never prints or returns anything.

ob_start();
print 'bar';    // This IS printed, but just not right here.
ob_end_flush(); // It's printed here, because ob_end_flush "prints" what's in
                // the buffer, rather than returning it
                //     (unlike the ob_get_* functions)
